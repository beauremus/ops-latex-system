The bidi package
v12 (Final Version)

This package provides a convenient interface for typesetting
bidirectional texts in Plain TeX and LaTeX.

In this version, a new experimental package, namely,
bidi-longtable.sty is provided for typesetting bidirectional
longtables with longtable package. bidi-longtable.sty should
be loaded after bidi package.This is the final version of bidi
package and no more updates of bidi package will appear.
I am working on a commercial package (namely Simurgh,
for typesetting high quality Persian/English documents with
LuaTeX, which does not have bugs and limitations of bidi
package) and therefore do not wish to continue the
development of bidi package. Hence you may like to consider
bidi as obsolete and may wish to purchase a copy of Simurgh
package. If you are interested to purchase a copy of Simurgh
package, then send me an email. Please do not email me with
questions/queries about bugs/limitations/usage of bidi package;
I am not interested in those emails and your email will be deleted
immediately without replying back.
