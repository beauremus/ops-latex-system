Version 2.3 of package xgreek

In this version the \stigma command expands to the letters sigma tau.
If one wants this command to expand to the stigma symbol, she has to
use the stigma package option.

Version 2.2 of package xgreek

In version 2.2 it was removed the first entry of \refname in \@ncientn@mes.

In version 2.1 I have introduced some new \lccode-\uccode pairs that
reflect current changes in Unicode 5.2 while I have corrected the
values for an existing pair.

Version 2.0 of package xgreek

Package xgreek  has been designed so to allow people to typeset 
Greek language documents using XeLaTeX. And it is released in 
the hope that people will use it and spot errors, bugs, features
so to improve it. Practically, it provides all the capabilities 
of the greek option of the babel package. The package can be 
invoced with any of the following options: monogreek (for 
typesetting modern monotonic Greek), polygreek (for typesetting 
modern polytonic Greek), and ancientgreek (for typesetting 
ancient texts). The default option is monogreek. The command
\setlanguage{lang} to activate the hyphenation patterns of the 
lang. The format file should be built with standard tools. The 
contents of a minimal language.dat file follow:

american        ushyphmax.tex
ancientgreek    loadhyph-grc.tex
monogreek       loadhyph-el-monoton.tex
greek           loadhyph-el-polyton.tex
