                    The luatex hyphenation package.

This package aims at replacing the standard hyphen.cfg for LuaTeX. The main
difference is that the patterns are loaded at runtime and not in the format.
This leads to much shorter format loading time, with no loss as the 
patterns are not really loaded in the format, just copied and then loaded
at runtime.

This package is developped on <http://github.com/eroux/luatex-hyphen>.

Installation
------------

Here are the recommended installation methods (preferred first).

1. If you are using TeX Live 2010 or later, the files are already installed.

2. a. Grab luatex-hyphen.tds.zip on the CTAN.
   b. Unzip it at the root of one or your TDS trees.
   c. Update some filename database after, and regenerate the formats for 
      LuaTeX. See your TeX distribution's manual for details.

3. a. Grab the sources from CTAN or github.
   b. Run 'make install TEXMFROOT=/path/to/texmf'.
